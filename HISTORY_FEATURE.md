## How to Use

### Managing Historical Tasks

- Confirmation is required

#### Delete an Entire Day

- Scroll to the bottom of that date's tasks
- Click **üóëÔ∏è Delete This Day**
- Confirmation is required
- This removes all Signal and Noise tasks for that date

### Navigation

## Features

### Automatic Archiving
When a new day begins:
- The app automatically archives yesterday's tasks to history
- Today's task list starts fresh
- Historical data is preserved forever (until manually deleted)

### Date-Based Organization
- Tasks are organized by their creation date
- You can view tasks from any day
- Each day's tasks are independent

### Color Coding
- **Signal tasks**: Red accent (üéØ)
- **Noise tasks**: Green accent (üìù)
- Same color scheme as the main view for consistency

### Completion Tracking
- See at a glance how many tasks were completed each day
- Visual indicators show done vs. total tasks
- Completed tasks appear with strikethrough text

## Use Cases

1. Open History
2. Click "Add Tasks to Date"
3. Select a future date
4. Add Signal and Noise tasks for that day
5. When that day arrives, those tasks will be in your Today view

### Reviewing Past Performance
1. Open History
2. Browse through past dates
3. See what you accomplished
4. Review completed vs. incomplete tasks
5. Use insights to improve planning

### Correcting Missed Tasks
1. Open History

## Data Storage

### How It Works
- Current day's tasks stored in: `signalnoise_tasks`
- Historical tasks stored in: `signalnoise_history`
- Each date is a key with array of tasks as value
- All data stored locally using Capacitor Preferences
- No internet connection required
- Data persists across app restarts

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "2025-10-01": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "title": "Complete project",
      "done": true,
      "type": "signal",
      "date": "2025-10-01"
    }
  ],
  "2025-09-30": [...]
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Daily Review
- At the end of each day, review your History
- Mark any completed tasks you forgot to check
- Add any tasks you worked on but didn't track

### Weekly Planning
- Use History to plan next week
- Look at patterns in past weeks
- Add tasks to future dates based on your schedule

### Progress Tracking
- Review your History weekly or monthly
- Count completed Signal tasks
- Identify productive patterns
- Adjust your planning accordingly

### Data Cleanup
- Periodically review old dates
- Delete dates you no longer need
- Keep your history focused and relevant

## Troubleshooting

### History Not Showing

### Performance Issues
- Large history (100+ dates) may slow loading
- Consider deleting very old dates
- Contact support if issues persist

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Export history to CSV/JSON
- Import tasks from files
- Search across all dates
