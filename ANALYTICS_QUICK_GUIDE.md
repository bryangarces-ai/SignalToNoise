### Understanding Your Dashboard

#### 1. Time Period Filter (Top Section)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Daily (7 days)] [Weekly] [Monthly]     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- **Daily**: See last 7 days at a glance
- **Weekly**: View 4 weeks of trends
- **Monthly**: Analyze 3 months of data

#### 2. Summary Cards
```
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│ 🎯 78.5%    │ │ ✅ 82.3%    │ │ ⚡ 65.2%    │ │ 📋 45/60    │
│ Avg Planned │ │ Avg Signal  │ │ Avg Product │ │ Completed   │
│ Signal      │ │ Completion  │ │ -ivity      │ │             │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

#### 3. Three Main Charts

**A. Planned Ratio Chart (Stacked Bar)**
```
Shows: How you plan your tasks
Goal: 80% Signal (green), 20% Noise (red)

100% ┤               ████ 
 80% ┤     ████ ████ ████  ← Target: 80% Signal
 60% ┤ ████ ████ ████ ████
 40% ┤ ████ ████ ████ ████
 20% ┤ ████ ████ ████ ████  ← Noise should be ~20%
  0% ┴─────────────────────
     Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri

Green = Signal Tasks
Red = Noise Tasks
```

**B. Completion Progress Chart (Line)**
```
Shows: Task completion rates over time
Insight: Are you executing what you planned?

100% ┤         ╱─╲
 80% ┤    ╱─╲╱   ╲    Signal Line
 60% ┤   ╱           ╲╱
 40% ┤  ╱  ╱─╲  ╱─╲    Noise Line
 20% ┤ ╱  ╱   ╲╱
  0% ┴─────────────────────
     Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri

Tip: Signal line should stay above Noise line
```

**C. Productivity Ratio Chart (Doughnut)**
```
Shows: Average work distribution

        ╱────╲
       │  65% │  Signal Completed (Green)
       │  15% │  Noise Completed (Red)
       │  20% │  Incomplete (Gray)
        ╲────╱

Ideal: Green > 60%, Red < 20%, Gray < 30%
```

## Reading Your Insights

### 🎯 Planning Quality
- **What it means**: How well you plan your Signal-to-Noise ratio
- **Green (75%+)**: Perfect! Your planning aligns with 80:20 goal
- **Yellow (60-75%)**: Good, but room for improvement
- **Red (<60%)**: Too many Noise tasks planned

### ✅ Execution Focus
- **What it means**: How well you complete Signal tasks
- **Green (70%+)**: Great execution on important tasks
- **Yellow (50-70%)**: Decent, but prioritize Signal tasks more
- **Red (<50%)**: Struggling to complete important tasks

### ⚡ Overall Productivity
- **What it means**: Total task completion rate
- **Green (70%+)**: Excellent task completion
- **Yellow (50-70%)**: Room to improve completion
- **Red (<50%)**: Consider planning fewer or smaller tasks

## Common Patterns & What They Mean

### Pattern 1: High Planned Signal, Low Signal Completion
```
Planned: 80% Signal ✓
Completed: 40% Signal ✗
```
**Issue**: Planning well but not executing
**Fix**: Break Signal tasks into smaller chunks

### Pattern 2: Low Planned Signal, High Noise Completion
```
Planned: 50% Signal ✗
Completed: 70% Noise ✗
```
**Issue**: Too focused on maintenance work
**Fix**: Plan more Signal tasks, resist Noise temptation

### Pattern 3: Consistent High Performance
```
Planned: 80% Signal ✓
Completed: 75% Signal ✓
```
**Result**: Excellent! You're in the productivity zone!

### Pattern 4: Declining Trend
```
Week 1: 80% → Week 2: 70% → Week 3: 60%
```
**Issue**: Burnout or distraction increasing
**Fix**: Review priorities, take breaks, reduce Noise
